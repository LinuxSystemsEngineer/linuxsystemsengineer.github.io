# Personal Professional Website

This GitHub repository contains the code for my personal and professional website. Displaying my skills and experience with a clean, modern theme.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML**: The foundation for website structure, defining the content and its organization.
- **CSS**: Responsible for visual styling, including layout, fonts, colors, and responsive design for optimal viewing across devices.

## Programming Process

The website started its journey based on the free "Startup Template" offered with W3Schools ([W3Schools Templates](https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp)). This template served as a solid base, allowing me to customize it and create a website that reflects my brand and highlights my work experiences.
